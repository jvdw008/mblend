<h2>Why will my project not run?</h2>
<p>Are you sure you don't have any build errors?</p>
<p>Are you sure your main filename is the same as the project name? (This is a Monkey-X requirement)</p>
<h2>How can I get all my files?</h2>
<p>If you are a paid user, you are able to Zip up your projects for download. As a free user, you can copy and paste your code into another editor.</p>
<h2>The font-size is too large/small. How can I change this?</h2>
<p>As a paid user, you have access to various options, including changing the font-size for the editor.</p>
<h2>How do I share my build folder?</h2>
<p>Build your project, then click the Launch button. Grab the resultant URL from your browser address bar.</p>
<h2>The build is running slowly in my browser</h2>
<p>That's because it's using your device's own resources. If you have a slow phone or tablet, running web-based games on it may not run as fast as you expected.</p>
<h2>Why when I double click on a keyword does no help appear?</h2>
<p>If the keyword exists it will show an inline help box which displays the definition or syntax. If it doesn't try press F1 to go to the full Monkey-X documentation.</p>
<h2>There are updates to the editor but I don't see them?</h2>
<p>Most likely it's your browser cache. You will have to empty/clear your browser cache and do a hard refresh to see the updates. Follow <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank">this guide</a>.</p>
