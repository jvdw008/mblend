# mblend
Web-based IDE for the Cerberus X game development language/framework

Introduction
 mBlend was created to fill a need for a web-based IDE to prototype games for the language and framework called Cerberus X (then called Monkey-X).
 It allowed the user to get a free account and let them create two project for prototyping, and paid accounts were unlimited with files and projects.

 You could then work on any device that has a browser and run your prototype in a new browser tab!

Feel free to explore how it was done and I hope someone learns from this or gets any further ideas!
